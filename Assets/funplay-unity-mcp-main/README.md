Funplay MCP for Unity is an MIT-licensed Unity Editor MCP server that lets AI assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, and VS Code Copilot operate directly inside your running Unity project.

Describe your game in one sentence — your AI assistant builds it in Unity through Funplay MCP for Unity's 79 built-in tools for scene creation, script generation, runtime validation, input simulation, performance analysis, and editor automation.

> *"Build a snake game with a 10x10 grid, food spawning, score UI, and game-over screen"*
>
> Your AI assistant handles it through Funplay MCP for Unity: creates the scene, generates all scripts, sets up the UI, and configures the game logic — all from a single prompt.

## Quick Start

If you just want to get connected fast, do these three things:

- Install the Unity package from the Git URL
- Start `Funplay > MCP Server`
- Use the built-in one-click client configuration

### 1. Install via UPM (Git URL)

In Unity, go to **Window → Package Manager → + → Add package from git URL**:

```
https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-unity-mcp.git
```

> 💡 Before you clone or install, a quick ⭐ on GitHub would be greatly appreciated.

### 2. Start the MCP Server

**Menu: Funplay → MCP Server** to start the server.

The server starts on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` by default.

### 3. Configure Your AI Client

Use the built-in **One-Click MCP Configuration** in the `Funplay > MCP Server` window first.

Select your target client, click **Configure**, and the package writes the recommended MCP config entry for you.

If you want project-specific AI guidance for the current Unity project, open **Funplay → Project Skills (Experimental)** to choose supported platforms and install built-in plus optional skills.

If you prefer to edit config files manually, use the examples below as fallback references:

```toml
[mcp_servers.funplay]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8765/"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windsurf</summary>

Use the same JSON structure as Cursor unless your local Windsurf version requires a different MCP config format.

</details>

### 4. Verify the Connection

Open your AI client and try a few safe requests first:

- "Call `get_scene_info` and tell me what scene is open."
- "Read `unity://project/context` and summarize the current editor state."
- "Use `execute_code` to return the active scene name."

If those work, the MCP server, resources, and primary execution tool are connected correctly.

### 5. Start Building

Open your AI client and try: *"Create a 3D platformer level with 5 floating platforms"*

## Before You Start

- This package is **Editor-only**. It does not add runtime components to your built game.
- The MCP server starts on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` by default.
- Local MCP server settings are stored in `UserSettings/FunplayMcpSettings.json`.
- The package defaults to the `core` MCP tool profile to reduce tool-list noise for AI clients. `core` currently exposes 19 high-signal tools centered on `execute_code`, play mode control, input simulation, screenshots, performance inspection, logs, and compilation checks. Switch to `full` in the MCP Server window if you want all 79 tools exposed.
- All exposed MCP tools run directly. There is no extra approval toggle.
- **Menu: `Funplay > Check for Updates`** can refresh Git installs in place or download and import the latest `unitypackage` automatically.

## Why This Project

- **`execute_code` First** — The package is optimized around one high-flexibility C# execution tool for rich editor/runtime orchestration when many small tools would be noisy
- **Play Mode Automation** — Enter play mode, simulate keyboard/mouse input, capture screenshots, inspect logs, and validate behavior from the same MCP session
- **Project Context Built In** — Exposes live resources for project state, active scene, selection, compilation, console output, and MCP interaction history
- **Focused by Default, Full When Needed** — `core` exposes a compact high-signal toolset; `full` exposes all 79 tools
- **Single Unity Package** — No extra approval UI, no external daemon to click through, and no Python requirement for the Unity-side plugin itself
- **Extensible** — Add custom tools with attribute-based discovery, or connect Unity to external MCP services when needed

## Highlights

- **79 Built-in Tools** — Scene editing, assets, scripts, play mode control, screenshots, performance analysis, prompts, resources, and editor automation across 19 modules
- **Resources & Prompts** — Live project context, scene/selection/error resources, resource templates, and reusable workflow prompts
- **Input Simulation + Screenshots** — Drive play mode with keyboard/mouse simulation and verify results with game/scene captures
- **Built-in Updating** — Check for updates from the Unity menu and either re-pull the Git package or auto-import the latest `unitypackage`
- **One-Click Client Configuration** — Generate MCP config entries for Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Kiro, Trae, Codex, and similar clients directly from the Unity window
- **Project Skills Manager (Experimental)** — Configure project-level skills for supported AI clients, with built-in skills plus optional installable skills
- **Vendor Agnostic** — Works with any AI client that supports MCP: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, VS Code Copilot, etc.

## Comparison With Coplay

The table below compares this repository with the publicly documented behavior of Coplay's open-source `unity-mcp` repository on GitHub.

| Area | Funplay MCP for Unity | Coplay `unity-mcp` |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Unity-side architecture | Embedded Unity Editor package with built-in HTTP MCP server | Unity bridge plus local Python MCP server |
| Extra local prerequisites | Unity package only for core workflows | Unity + Python 3.10+ + `uv` according to the public quick start |
| Primary workflow style | `execute_code` first, then focused helper tools | Broad `manage_*` tool families exposed through the bridge |
| Default tool exposure | Compact `core` profile with optional `full` expansion | Public docs emphasize a broad always-available tool surface |
| Built-in context model | Project resources, resource templates, workflow prompts, interaction history | Public README emphasizes tool families and bridge/server workflow |
| Play mode validation | Built-in play mode control, screenshots, logs, and input simulation in the package | Public README emphasizes broad Unity management and automation tools |
| Positioning | Lightweight, direct, MIT-licensed Unity MCP server for AI-driven editor control | Full-featured Unity bridge maintained by Coplay with Python-backed server setup |

## MCP Capabilities

The current open-source package exposes four high-value capability layers:

- **Tools** — 79 total tools in `full`, 19 focused tools in `core`
- **Primary execution** — `execute_code` for rich editor/runtime orchestration
- **Prompts** — workflow prompts like `fix_compile_errors`, `runtime_validation`, and `create_playable_prototype`
- **Resources** — project context, scene summaries, selection state, compile errors, console errors, MCP interaction history, plus resource templates for scene objects, components, and asset paths

| **Visual Feedback** | `select_object`, `focus_on_object`, `ping_asset`, `log_message`, `show_dialog`, `get_console_logs` |

## Adding Custom Tools

Create your own tools with simple attribute annotations:

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;

[ToolProvider("MyTools")]
public static class MyCustomTools
{
    [Description("Spawns enemies at random positions in the scene")]
    public static string SpawnEnemies(
        [ToolParam("Number of enemies to spawn", Required = true)] int count,
        [ToolParam("Prefab path in Assets")] string prefabPath)
    {
        // Your implementation here
        return $"Spawned {count} enemies";
    }
}
```

Methods are automatically discovered, converted to snake_case (`spawn_enemies`), and exposed via MCP with JSON Schema definitions.

## Architecture

```
MCP Server (HTTP JSON-RPC 2.0)
    └─ MCPRequestHandler (protocol handling)
        └─ MCPExecutionBridge
            └─ FunctionInvokerController (reflection-based invocation)
                └─ Tool Functions (79 built-in tools across 19 modules)
```

```
External AI Client → HTTP Request → MCPRequestHandler → MCPExecutionBridge → FunctionInvokerController → tool method
```

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 or later
- .NET / Mono with `Newtonsoft.Json`
